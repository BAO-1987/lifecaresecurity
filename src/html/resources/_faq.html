            What is the difference between term life and whole life insurance?
          </summary>

          <div>
            <p>
              Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period,
              typically 10, 20, or 30 years, while whole life insurance offers
              lifelong coverage with a cash value component that accumulates
              over time.

          <summary>How much life insurance coverage do I need?</summary>

          <div>
            <p>
              The amount of life insurance coverage you need depends on factors
              such as your income, debts, future expenses, and financial goals.
              A general rule of thumb is to have coverage equal to 5-10 times
              your annual income.

          <summary>What factors affect life insurance premiums?</summary>

          <div>
            <p>
              Life insurance premiums are determined based on factors such as
              age, health, lifestyle habits, coverage amount, policy type, and
              term length. Generally, younger and healthier individuals pay
              lower premiums.

          <summary>How do I file a life insurance claim?</summary>

          <div>
            <p>
              To file a life insurance claim, you typically need to submit a
              claim form, along with a death certificate and any other required
              documents, to the insurance company. The insurer will review the
              claim and process the payout accordingly.

            Can I change my life insurance policy after purchasing it?
          </summary>

          <div>
            <p>
              Yes, you can make changes to your life insurance policy after
              purchasing it, such as increasing or decreasing coverage amounts,
              adding or removing riders, or changing beneficiaries. However,
              these changes may be subject to approval by the insurance company
              and could affect your premiums.
