          <p>
            Term life insurance offers coverage for a specified period, typically ranging from 5 to 30 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this term, your beneficiaries will receive a death benefit if you pass away.
          </p>
          <p>
            This type of policy is often more affordable than permanent life insurance and can provide financial
            protection during critical periods, such as when paying off a mortgage or raising children.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's an excellent option for those seeking straightforward coverage at an affordable rate.

            whole life insurance
          </h3>
          <p>
            Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage, meaning it lasts for the insured's entire life as long as
            premiums are paid.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the death benefit, whole life policies also accumulate cash value over time, which can be
            borrowed against or withdrawn for various purposes
          </p>
          <p>
            Premiums are typically higher than term life insurance but remain level throughout the policy's duration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whole life insurance offers stability, guaranteed death benefits, and the potential for cash value growth.
